# EtCloudFhe

A cloud-based, privacy-preserving system that enables **secure Electron Microscopy Tomography (ET)** processing using **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**. Researchers can upload encrypted tomography datasets to the cloud, where all 3D reconstruction and structural analysis occur without ever decrypting the data. The system ensures that sensitive biological imagery‚Äîoften containing unpublished or confidential experimental results‚Äîremains protected throughout the computation pipeline.

## Overview

Electron microscopy tomography (ET) is an essential tool in modern life sciences, providing nanoscale 3D views of cellular and tissue structures.  
However, cloud-based ET processing poses a critical challenge: **how can researchers leverage the computational power of the cloud without exposing sensitive biological data**?

**EtCloudFhe** solves this by integrating **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** into the ET workflow.  
FHE allows mathematical operations to be performed directly on encrypted data, producing encrypted outputs that can later be decrypted by authorized users ‚Äî **without ever exposing the raw images to the cloud provider**.

This design enables secure cloud collaboration among research institutions while maintaining full data confidentiality.

## Architecture

The EtCloudFhe system is built around a modular privacy-first architecture:

### 1. Client Layer (Researcher‚Äôs Environment)
- Performs initial encryption of ET image stacks using an FHE library before upload.
- Provides a local viewer for decrypted 3D results.
- Compatible with standard ET data formats (MRC, TIFF, or HDF5).

### 2. Cloud Compute Layer
- Executes encrypted computations, including alignment, back-projection, and 3D volume reconstruction.
- Implements homomorphic variants of common ET algorithms:
  - Encrypted Radon transform
  - Encrypted weighted back-projection
  - Encrypted Fourier-domain filtering
- Uses GPU acceleration and memory-aware partitioning for large datasets.

### 3. Security & Control Layer
- Manages encryption keys and computation authorization.
- Supports cryptographic audit trails for computation integrity.
- Enforces zero-knowledge processing ‚Äî the cloud has **no decryption capability**.

### 4. Result Handling
- Encrypted results are returned to the researcher.
- Local decryption restores reconstructed 3D volumes for visualization and analysis.

## Why FHE Matters

In traditional cloud-based ET workflows:
- Raw microscopy data must be uploaded unencrypted.
- Service providers or insiders may gain access to unpublished biological structures.
- Regulatory frameworks (e.g., biomedical data confidentiality) can restrict data sharing.

With **Fully Homomorphic Encryption**:
- Data remains encrypted end-to-end.
- The cloud can perform 3D reconstruction without decryption.
- No trust is required in the service provider.
- Researchers can safely use cloud computation for sensitive data, enabling large-scale, cross-institutional collaboration.

In short, **FHE transforms the cloud from a risk into a trusted computational ally**.

## Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Researchers preprocess and normalize ET slices locally.
   - Data is encrypted using a public FHE key.

2. **Secure Upload**
   - The encrypted dataset is uploaded to the EtCloudFhe service.
   - No plaintext image ever leaves the researcher‚Äôs environment.

3. **Encrypted Processing**
   - The cloud performs all operations in the encrypted domain.
   - Intermediate results remain unintelligible to the system operators.

4. **Result Retrieval**
   - The encrypted 3D reconstruction is downloaded.
   - The researcher decrypts results locally for visualization or further analysis.
